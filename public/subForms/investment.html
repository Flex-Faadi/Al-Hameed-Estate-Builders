                <h2>Scheme 33</h2>

                to buying properties in the city of lights. This popularity is mainly due to the affordable investment

                <h2>North Karachi</h2>
                North Karachi Township is located on the northern edges of Karachi, past North Nazimabad. The town
                comprises six sectors with a mix of residential and commercial real estate investment opportunities.
                Let’s discuss the possibilities of buying a property in North Karachi in detail using the data we’ve
                gathered <br><br>

                Surrounded by prominent areas like Buffer Zone, New Karachi Town, Surjani Town, Naya Nazimabad,
                Gulshan-e-Maymar, and North Nazimabad, North Karachi caters primarily to the low and middle-income
                families of Karachi. They took up residence in the now densely packed society when it was mostly barren
                lands. It is also known as North Karachi Township, and has 6 sectors, from Sector 7 up to Sector 12.
                <br><br>

                While North Karachi features both houses and flats, most apartment buildings have a commercial
                storefront on the ground floor, with low-rise or mid-rise residential structures catering to both buyers
                and renters. Prominent routes within the society include Shahrah-e-Usman and Shahrah-e-Noor Jahan, which
                pass through the development and are also its commercial hubs. Chowrangis and Chowks, including Anda
                Mor, Disco Mor, Nagan Chowrangi, Power House Chowrangi, and Saba Cinema Roundabout, play a major role in
                the area for the locals, as these are the main places for trade and commerce with weekly area markets
                providing all the essentials at affordable rates. <br><br>

                Other prominent landmarks in or near the society include Hira Park, North Karachi Graveyard, Iqra
                University’s (IU) North campus, North Karachi Gym, Club, & Swimming Pool, Tikon Park, Rashid Latif
                Cricket Academy, and Aiwan-e-Tijarat-o-Sanat Hospital, along with campuses of several reputable schools
                and colleges. Sakhi Hassan Graveyard, Manghopir Lake, Naya Nazimabad Cricket Ground, Sohrab Goth, North
                Karachi’s Industrial Area, the University of Karachi (UoK), Manghopir Road, and the M-9
                Karachi-Hyderabad Motorway are some of the other prominent landmarks near this residential community.

            <span>
                <h2>Surjani Town</h2>
                Surjani Town in District West is being pitched as a new avenue for investors or low- and middle-income
                people who want to own a house. <br><br>

                Surjani Town is one of the neighborhoods of Gadap Town, and if you look at the map, it is to the left of
                Karachi spread over 6,600 acres of land that belongs to the Karachi Development Authority or KDA.
                Surjani Town has 17 sectors in which 15 have been set aside for housing schemes that were launched by
                the KDA in 1984. <br><b></b>

                Real estate agents who work in the area find that they are mostly dealing with working class clients who
                want to live in their own house and will buy plots that are 60, 80, and 120 square yards. <br><br>

                “People mostly prefer 120 square yard plots for residential use so that is why prices have gone a bit
                over a year in different sectors,” he said, naming Sectors L-2, L-4, L-5, L-6, L-7 and L-10. L-2, 5, 6,
                7 have price tags of Rs3 million to Rs3.5 million. <br><br>

                Some of these goths, however, were part of Karachi’s original list and have been documented by Perween
                Rehman. The mapped goths include Brohi Goth, Saiful Marri Goth, Yousuf Goth, Dil Murad Khan Goth, and
                Ayub Goth. <br><br>
